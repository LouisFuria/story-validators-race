Hey broskies,
I hope you're doing well! ðŸ˜Š

I'm currently a validator on a bunch of projects like Eclipse, Linea, Rivalz, and more. 
But recently, Iâ€™ve had a bit of a crush on Story and would love to get more involved in the community.

Aside from being a validator, I also manage a cool little community of 600 people on X where Iâ€™m known for writing threads and updates on projects Iâ€™m passionate about. 
Plus, Iâ€™m part of the core team in a DAO with over 1,200 members, where I help organize both online and IRL events.

Iâ€™d really love to contribute more to Story â€“ whether thatâ€™s validating, writing threads, or even helping host some meetups or events. 
Let me know if there's a way to collaborate, and Iâ€™m all in!

Best,
Louis Furia.
